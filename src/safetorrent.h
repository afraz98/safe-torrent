 *  1. Parsing Torrent Files:
 *      The first step is to parse the Torrent files to extract information such as the file(s) being shared, 
 *      tracker URLs, and metadata. You can use the bencode library to parse and serialize the .torrent file data.
 *  2. Establishing a Connection:
 *      Next, you need to establish a connection with the tracker server to request peers. 
 *      You can use the libcurl library for HTTP-based communication and the UDP Sockets for UDP-based communication with the tracker.
 *  3. Handshaking:
 *      After getting the list of peers from the tracker server, you need to connect to those peers to exchange data. 
 *      BitTorrent uses a handshake mechanism to establish connections with peers. You can use the Boost.Asio library to implement the handshake protocol.
 *
 *  4. Downloading and Uploading:
 *      Once the connection is established, the client can download and upload pieces of the shared files. 
 *      You can use the libtorrent library to manage the download and upload of pieces. 
 *      This library provides a high-level interface for handling the BitTorrent protocol.
 *
 * 5. Piece Selection:
 *      To optimize the download process, the client should choose the right pieces to download from the peer. 
 *      The libtorrent library provides several algorithms for piece selection, such as rarest-first and endgame mode.
 *
 * 6. Piece Verification:
 *      The client should verify each downloaded piece before it can be used. You can use the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to calculate the hash of each piece 
 *      and compare it with the hash provided in the .torrent file.
 *
 * 7. User Interface:
 *      Finally, you can add a user interface to your BitTorrent client to display the progress of the download and upload process. 
 *      You can use the Qt library to create a GUI for your client.
